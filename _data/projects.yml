  description: |
    We are developing a smart IoT climate control system and would like to leverage machine learning techniques for occupancy prediction (based on incoming sensor data, what is the probability that a room will be occupied in the next 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or 1 hour) and for damper actuation (based on incoming sensor data and temperature target, when should heating/cooling be turned on and which heating/cooling dampers should be actuated).

  name: Knowledge-backed Generation Model Using Post-Modifier Dataset (PoMo)
  dates: November 2019
  github: shanujshekhar/Improvement-on-Knowledge-backed-Generation-Model-Using-Post-Modifier-Dataset
  quote: >
   I have generated phrases to describe an entity in a sentence using Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding
  description: |
    
    Post-modifier is a short descriptive phrase that comes after a word (usually a noun) in a sentence which gives more detailed contextual information about that word. Post modifier generation model has two sub tasks - selecting a set of facts or claims about the concerned entity (WikiData) and from that set selecting the most relevant fact to generate a post modifier that contextually describes it.(POMO Dataset)
    
    The task of post modifier generation requires to automatically generate a post modifier phrase describing the target entity (an entity essentially refers to a noun but here we only consider people) that contextually fits in the input sentence. Model Architecture - Bi-LSTM (2 layer) model with attention function

    Designed Virtual Scene of Solar System consisting of Sun, Moon, Stars, cargo-ship, spaceship, etc. (Modelled using Blender 2.8).
  description: |
    Implemented features like gravity, switching cameras of game, revolving and rotational motion of planets, driving spaceship. Spaceship is equipped with the state-of-the-art selection ray which can pick-up and move objects using VR controllers. Used these rays to retrieve the cargo boxes released into space by the cargo-ship. Designed a greenhouse on a Planet where I made the player do some random tasks like aligning cargo boxes, etc. Designed teleportation tube to teleport into the greenhouse.

  dates: October 2019
  github: shanujshekhar/Relation_Classification_in_NLP
  description: |
    Given 10 predefined relations like cause-effect, product-producer, etc, the goal was to define the relation and the direction of the relation b/w 2 entities in a sentence. I did this relation classification task in Python using Tensorflow library. I already had the pre-trained word embedding (glove) to train the data available. I had to setup Parts of Speech tag embedding and parse the shortest dependancy path b/w the 2 entities to build the model and then generate predictions.
