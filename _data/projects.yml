  description: |
    We are developing a smart IoT climate control system and would like to leverage machine learning techniques for occupancy prediction (based on incoming sensor data, what is the probability that a room will be occupied in the next 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or 1 hour) and for damper actuation (based on incoming sensor data and temperature target, when should heating/cooling be turned on and which heating/cooling dampers should be actuated).
    
    Languages and Tools Used: Python, Deep Neural Networks, PyTorch
