  description: |
    We are developing a smart IoT climate control system and would like to leverage machine learning techniques for occupancy prediction (based on incoming sensor data) and for damper actuation (based on incoming sensor data and temperature target, when should heating/cooling be turned on and which heating/cooling dampers should be actuated).

    I have created a dashboard for visualizing COVID-19 cases in the USA, how the disease spread and how it affected the country’s unemployment rates. I have created two modes for our dashboard - one for the unemployment data and one for the COVID-19 case data to show the spread in different states and counties.

   I have generated phrases to describe an entity in a sentence using Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding
  description: |    
    The task of post modifier generation requires to automatically generate a post modifier phrase describing the target entity (an entity essentially refers to a noun but here we only consider people) that contextually fits in the input sentence.

    Designed Virtual Scene of Solar System consisting of Sun, Moon, Stars, cargo-ship, spaceship, etc. (Modelled using Blender 2.8).
  description: |
    Implemented features like gravity, switching cameras of game, revolving and rotational motion of planets, driving spaceship. Spaceship is equipped with the state-of-the-art selection ray which can pick-up and move objects using VR controllers. Designed a greenhouse on a Planet where I made the player do some random tasks like aligning cargo boxes, etc. Designed teleportation tube to teleport into the greenhouse.
