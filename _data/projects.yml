  description: |
    We are developing a smart IoT climate control system and would like to leverage machine learning techniques for occupancy prediction (based on incoming sensor data, what is the probability that a room will be occupied in the next 5 minutes, 15 minutes, or 1 hour) and for damper actuation (based on incoming sensor data and temperature target, when should heating/cooling be turned on and which heating/cooling dampers should be actuated).
    
    Topic: Machine Learning
    
    Languages and Tools Used: Python, Deep Neural Networks, PyTorch

  dates: January 2020
  github: shanujshekhar/Augmented_Reality_Video_Game_using_Unity_Tool
  description: |
    I have designed a game in which a user can interactively build an augmented 3D scene on a planar surface in the real world. My application has two modes: a build mode and a game mode and application starts with a menu of two buttons displaying the two modes.

  name: Knowledge-backed Generation Model Using Post-Modifier Dataset (PoMo)
  dates: November 2019
  github: shanujshekhar/Improvement-on-Knowledge-backed-Generation-Model-Using-Post-Modifier-Dataset
  quote: >
   I have generated phrases to describe an entity in a sentence using Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding
  description: |
    
    Post-modifier is a short descriptive phrase that comes after a word (usually a noun) in a sentence which gives more detailed contextual information about that word. Post modifier generation model has two sub tasks - selecting a set of facts or claims about the concerned entity (WikiData) and from that set selecting the most relevant fact to generate a post modifier that contextually describes it.(POMO Dataset)
    
    The task of post modifier generation requires to automatically generate a post modifier phrase describing the target entity (an entity essentially refers to a noun but here we only consider people) that contextually fits in the input sentence. Model Architecture - Bi-LSTM (2 layer) model with attention function

  description: |
    This project titled “Emotion Recognition for Real-Time Feedback” performs facial expression analysis in near real-time from a live webcam feed. It classifies human expressions into 8 different classes (Happy, Sad, Angry, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Surprise, Neutral) with an accuracy of 67% .

    A numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus
  description: |
    Calculated the term frequency for terms present in 2000 documents. (Dataset- http://mlg.ucd.ie/files/datasets/bbc-fulltext.zip). Found the top 10 most important terms for each document.
